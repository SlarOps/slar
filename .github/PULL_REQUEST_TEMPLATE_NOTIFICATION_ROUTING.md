# Notification Routing Implementation - PR Checklist

## üìã Implementation Phase

- [ ] Phase 1: Database Migration
- [ ] Phase 2: Application Service Updates  
- [ ] Phase 3: Router Worker
- [ ] Phase 4: Slack Worker Updates
- [ ] Phase 5: Testing
- [ ] Phase 6: Email Worker (Optional)

## ‚úÖ Database Changes

### Migration
- [ ] Created `add_notification_routing_support.sql`
- [ ] Extended `user_notification_configs` table
- [ ] Extended `notification_logs` table
- [ ] Added indexes for performance
- [ ] Added helper views
- [ ] Tested migration on dev
- [ ] Tested rollback script
- [ ] Migration verified on staging

### Schema Verification
```sql
-- Run these queries to verify
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'user_notification_configs' 
AND column_name IN ('high_priority_channels', 'teams_enabled', 'email_digest_enabled');

SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'notification_logs' 
AND column_name IN ('notification_id', 'routed_at', 'metadata', 'priority');
```

## üîß Application Changes

### NotificationSender Updates
